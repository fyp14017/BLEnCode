 "This work was created using programs developed by the Catrobat project.

For the parts of the Catrobat system necessary for running a Catrobat program, e.g., the Catrobat Interpreter, the GNU Affero General Public License is supplemented by an additional permission under section 7 of version 3 of the License. This exception allows to convey a runtime version of a Catrobat program, for which you otherwise legally hold the necessary rights, in combination with the parts of the Catrobat system necessary for running that Catrobat program, under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the independent parts of the corresponding Catrobat program."
